A Spindizzy based game in Unreal Engine

This is a PoC of a Spindizzy/Marble Madness based game. I recreated the Spindizzy map in Unreal Engine 5. It is not finished, but the basics works and it is playable.
I simplify the elevators and clickable systems. Just use the same icon to switch on the corresponding elevator. The physics are realistic.

You can use the right mouse button to change the ball with normal (metallic), light or plastic (that can change direction in the air a little), and move with WASD. Take all the diamonds before the time goes out. Take a diamond is +10 seconds. Enter an undiscovered "8x8" square give +5 seconds.

I bought this game in C64 almost 40 years ago, and I can't finish it. This version in UE the same: can't finish it.

When I have time, I will make a miniMap (with no visited/visited wo diamonds/visited with diamond). And planned a entire level, "the mountain", with some bug fixing and improvements.
